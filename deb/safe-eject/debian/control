Description: seject - Safely eject USB drives
 A command-line utility to safely unmount and power off USB drives.
 It ensures data integrity by flushing the write cache, and confirming that no
 partitions remain mounted or in use, so the USB drive can be safely unplugged.
 The command accepts a single argument, which can be the USB drive device
 (e.g. /dev/sdX), or a USB partition device (e.g. /dev/sdXN). In both cases,
 the behavior is the same.
